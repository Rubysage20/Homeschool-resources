 <p> Hi! My name is Valerie. I am a Software Engineer and homeschooling mom. I have three girls (Butterfly, LadyBug & Turtle), I have been a homschooling mom for over 6 years now. Homeschooling is a great way to bond, and ensure that your childern are learning the necessary information to succeed in life. I decided to homeschool the moment I found out we were expecting our first baby, I never envisioned my girls being apart of the system. During my journey things have been a little heck, I'm definitely not a " by the book type of parent" I like to see what works for my team and I. So, with that being said I decided to create this webpage to help other parents on their journey into or in homeschooling. <br> HAPPY HOMESCHOOLING! </p> </div>
